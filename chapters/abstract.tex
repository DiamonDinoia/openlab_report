One of the most time consuming algorithms that is currently employed for the reconstruction of \textbf{High Energy Physics} (HEP) workflows is the local energy reconstruction. The time spent to execute this algorithm constitutes $24\%$ of the total processing time, thus achieving substantial speedup by optimizing this problem will noticeably influence the total processing time. Even a speedup of a factor of 1.5 will shorten the processing time by about $5\%$. The purpose of this project is to dig deep into both algorithmic and architecture dependent optimizations, trying to best exploit heterogenous resources to maximize \textbf{High Performance Computing} (HPC) utilization.
