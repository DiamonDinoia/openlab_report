This is a demo \LaTeX template you can use for your TUC Diplomas, Msc or PhD thesis. It can of course also be used for theses at other universities (be sure to use a high quality picture!!!) and other types of theses.

In this particular template special care has been taken to position the thesis title correctly on the front page for the TUC see-through box in the default cover. However, please check (and double check!) if this is still correct before you send your thesis to the repro shop and have copies printed. Additionally, we defined the command \textbackslash todo\{\} that produces a \todo{The ToDo note} ToDo note in the margin (and introduces some white space in the text unfortunately).

Good luck with your thesis.
